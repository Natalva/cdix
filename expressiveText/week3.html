<div class="center">laying on warm sand 
i stare into the enless blue 
 space above my eyes</div>

<div class="outside">as it swallows me whole
forgeting the world of skin and bones</div>

<div class="center">
Closing my eyes
rays of light seep into my eye lids 
glowing red and orange</div>

<div class="outside">forgeting that winter ever existed,
skin under the warm sun 
shifts to gold </div>

<div class="center">
as the sun picks me up and wraps her arms around me, 
healing and filling me with light</div>


<div class="outside">  her light flows into my bloodstream 
Boiling inside as I land back onto the sand
</div>

<div class="center">  staring into the ocean
submerging myself in blue
</div>


<div class="outside">  
bubbles of air surround me 
as i float to the surface
</div>


<div class="center">  the world exists only through sensations,
slowing down my thoughts
</div>

<div class="outside">  
I feel the freshness of the water, 
my thoughts sink to the ocean floor
burried under the sand 
</div>
